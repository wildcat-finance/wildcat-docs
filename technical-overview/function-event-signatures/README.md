# Function/Event Signatures

This page includes the names/parameters and signatures for most functions and events within Wildcat V2.

Note: you can generate this yourself via the `calculate_function_signatures.py` Python script in the `/script` directory of the repository.

We have not included everything here (e.g. mock contracts or widely-used libraries), but rather everything that is related to the mainnet deployment of Wildcat.
