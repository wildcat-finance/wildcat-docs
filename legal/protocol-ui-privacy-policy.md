## Introduction

Wildcat Foundation is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Wildcat and its affiliates (“we”, “us”, or “our”), might collect, use, and/or share your personal data when you access our company websites, including but not limited to, wildcat.finance (including the Wildcat app) and its sub-domains, and all of our other properties, products, and services (collectively the “Services”).

For the purposes of this Policy, personal data is any data related to an identified or identifiable individual. Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy as well as our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, do not access or use these Services, or any other aspect of our business.

## What Personal Data We Collect

When you visit our company websites and use our Services, we may collect the following data:

Publicly available blockchain data when you connect your non-custodial wallet to the Services. When you connect your non-custodial blockchain wallet to the Services, we may collect and log your publicly-available blockchain address in order to learn more about your use of the Services and to screen your wallet for any prior illicit activity. Note that blockchain addresses are publicly-available data that are not created or assigned by us or any central party, and by themselves are not personally identifying.

Information from localStorage and other tracking technologies. We and our third-party services providers may access and collect data from localStorage, mobile deviceID, cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to provide and personalise the Services and features of the Services for you across sessions.

Direct Communications that you send to us. Whenever you reach out to us through email, social media, or other support channels like X, Discord, or Telegram, or engage in surveys or questionnaires, we will receive the data and communications you share. It's important to note that we will not try to link any of this data to your wallet address, IP address, or any other personal details.

Information from job applicants. When you apply for a position with us, we collect all data you may provide, including name, email phone, work and immigration status, and any other resume, cover letter, or free form text you include.

## How We Use Your Data

As the operator of the Websites and Services, we take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We may use your personal data for the following purposes:

## How We Use Cookies

We use Cookies to track how you use our Services by providing usage statistics. Cookies are also used to deliver our information (including updates) and allow account authentication to you based upon your browsing history and previous visits to the Services. We may combine the information we collect from Cookies with personal information that we have collected from you to learn more about how you use our Services to improve it.

## Types of Cookies

We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To make it easier for you to understand why we need them, the Cookies we use on our Services can be grouped into the following categories:

## How We Share Your Data

We may share or disclose the data we collect in the limited circumstances as described below:

With regulators, government entities, and law enforcement to comply with our legal obligations

With service providers and vendors who may assist us in providing, delivering, and improving the Services (hosting provider, mailing provider, etc)

With blockchain security analytics providers to ensure the safety and security of our Services and to screen your wallet for any prior illicit activity

To enforce your agreements with us, including this Privacy Policy, and to respond to claims that your use of the Service violates any third-party rights

We require such third parties to use the personal data we share with them only for the purpose for which the data was transferred and not to retain it for longer than is required for fulfilling the said purpose.

## International Data Transfers

We, along with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and trusted third-party providers, may handle your personal information in countries outside of your own. The data privacy laws in these countries may differ from, and potentially offer less protection than, those in your home country.

When transferring your personal information internationally, and in accordance with applicable legal requirements, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure your data is adequately protected and compliant with relevant data protection laws. For further details on how we manage international data transfers, please contact us through the information provided in the “Contact Us” section of this policy.

This section will ensure that users are informed about how their data is managed when transferred internationally, in line with the rest of the privacy policy.

## Security

The security of your data is important to us, and we take reasonable security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure of your personal data under our control. The security measures in place will, from time to time, be reviewed in line with legal and technical developments.

However, given the inherent risks, we cannot guarantee absolute security and give no guarantee that such loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure will not occur. You are responsible for all of your activity on the Services, including the security of your blockchain network addresses, cryptocurrency wallets, and their cryptographic keys.

## Age Limitations

Our Services are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected personal data from an individual under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe we may have any information from or about a person under 18, please contact us.

We encourage you to review all policies, rules, terms and regulations, including the privacy policies, of each site that you visit.

## Changes to the Policy

Please note that we may modify this Privacy Policy at any time without any prior notice. The revised Policy will be effective immediately from when the revised Policy is posted in the Service and your continued access or use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to regularly review the latest version of this Privacy Policy

## Retention of Personal Information

We retain the personal data we collect only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, to provide our Services, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to comply with legal obligations. This period may vary depending on the nature of the data and the reasons for collecting it, having regard to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our own legal and regulatory requirements.
