# Wildcat Service Agreement

This Wildcat Protocol Services Agreement (this ’Agreement’) sets out the terms and conditions under you access the Wildcat Protocol (the ’Protocol’) and accept the Services (as defined below) that the Service Provider (also referred to as ’us’; or ’we’) will provide in connection with the Protocol.

By entering into this Agreement by clicking on the ’Sign’ (or similar) button, or by otherwise accessing or using the Protocol, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.

Using the Protocol can involve various risks. You can suffer loss and that is a risk you shall be able to take. If you do not understand the risks or are not willing to accept the risks or suffer loss, you should not enter into transactions on, or otherwise use, the Protocol. Before transacting, you must carefully assess and consider the risks, including those contained in any documents we make available to you and obtain all necessary professional advice you need.

You must decide for yourself whether you should participate in any transaction. The Service Provider is not required to advise you on the use of the Protocol and/or any aspects of a transaction you choose to enter into, protect or minimize your exposure to loss or provide any warnings to you. You must carefully consider and monitor your own transactions and in particular any loans you have made or taken out. We are not party to these transactions and therefore assume no obligation to monitor the same.

Unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, anything the Service Provider, including any of its affiliates, officers, employees or agents, may say to you is opinion only. You must not rely on it or hold the Service Provider liable for it, even if it is wrong. The Service Provider will not be liable for your losses in any circumstances, except as expressly set out in this Agreement or as required by applicable law.

This Agreement, including its Schedules, must be read in the context of any applicable Risk Disclosure Statement made available to you.

You acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed with the Risk Disclosure Statement that you can find on our Website (as defined below) and you will contact the Service Provider and/or cease to use the Protocol if you have any questions or concerns regarding the contents of the Risk Disclosure Statement.
