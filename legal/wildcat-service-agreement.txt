# 4 Products vs. Protocol

## 4.1 Products Overview
The Products include the websites wildcat.finance and app.wildcat.finance, along with related applications and tools. The Protocol, as further explained below, is a decentralised finance (DeFi) application for the lending and borrowing of Ethereum-based crypto assets. The Products provide a user interface and other means of interacting with the Protocol but do not include the Protocol itself. Neither the Company nor the Products manage or control transactions or assets using the Protocol beyond dictating who is eligible to deploy Markets using the Products - see Section 6.1 below (titled "Markets Overview").

## 4.2 Your responsibility to understand and accept Risk Disclosures Policy
Before interacting with the Products or Protocol, you are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the Risk Disclosures document available at https://docs.wildcat.finance/legal/risk-disclosure-statement. This document outlines the significant risks associated with decentralised finance applications, blockchain technology, and digital assets. BY USING THE PRODUCTS AND PROTOCOL, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND ACCEPTED THE RISKS DETAILED IN THE RISK DISCLOSURES. The Company disclaims all liability for losses resulting from these inherent risks, including but not limited to, smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, unforeseen interactions with other blockchain protocols, services and products. Your continued use of the Products and Protocol signifies your acceptance of these risks and your agreement to be bound by the terms outlined in the Risk Disclosures.

## 4.3 Protocol Independence

The Company makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the security, reliability, functionality, or availability of the Products and Protocol.

Users are solely responsible for understanding the risks of interacting with the Products and Protocol, including potential losses due to changes, forks, or failures in smart contracts.

## 4.6 Experimental Technology
You acknowledge that the Protocol and our Products operate on experimental technology. As such, you accept the inherent risks associated with using decentralised finance applications built on this technology. These risks include, but are not limited to, smart contract vulnerabilities, potential loss of digital assets, unforeseen interactions with other blockchain protocols or events, lack of warranties or other performance guarantees, lack of maintenance obligations, cyberattack vulnerabilities, and potential intellectual property infringement claims.

## 4.7 Assumption of Risk
By accessing and using the Protocol and Products, you acknowledge and agree that the Protocol operates autonomously on decentralised blockchain networks and that the Company has no control over the Protocol, its smart contracts, or their execution. You further acknowledge that interactions with the Protocol may expose you to significant risks, including but not limited to, irreversible transactions, market volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, and potential loss of digital assets.
