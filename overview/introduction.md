# Introduction

## The Elevator Pitch <a href="#the-elevator-pitch" id="the-elevator-pitch"></a>

Wildcat is a protocol that allows borrowers to deploy undercollateralised credit lines.\
\
That's it.\
\
Wildcat borrowers can dictate the terms of almost any parameter that they would care to adjust when crafting their credit line:

* underlying asset,
* interest rate,
* maximum capacity,
* penalties,
* withdrawal cycle lengths, and so on.

Borrowers can also impose various access constraints that they may require:

* disabling withdrawals for a certain period (corresponding to a fixed-duration agreement),
* disabling transfers for the tokenised debt that Wildcat issues,
* requiring lenders to prove compliance with a given profile before self-onboarding, etc.

Wildcat markets are not controlled or upgradable by the protocol itself once deployed.\
\
A market and its goings-on are between the borrowers and lenders alone.\
\
Wildcat itself doesn't liquidate collateral, can't freeze markets, can't access your funds.

Wildcat provides a template loan agreement between borrower and lender on a per-market basis, but you are free to decline to use this, or use your own.

### ​A Comment Before You Head Further In <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

This documentation is currently undergoing revision as the protocol shifts towards the deployment of V2 and the deprecation of V1. There may be some inconsistencies, which we are actively seeking out.

There is also some repetition of terms and definitions in various sections.

You aren't going insane: this is intentional, as we don't want (or expect) people to have to read through the entire site in order to understand the section that they're interested in.

After the V2 launch, we will be fleshing various pages out more screenshots, illustrations, videos and so forth to help explain more concepts more clearly - waves of text can be difficult to parse, and we're walking a tightrope between explaining the protocol to would-be users and also acting as a source of truth for security researchers and developers who would make use of or extend our code.

Please forgive any arcane ramblings: if there's anything you'd like to see expanded upon or clarified further, we'd consider it a favour if you got in touch with us.
