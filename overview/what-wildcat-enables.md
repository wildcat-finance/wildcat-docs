# What Wildcat Enables

The core premise of a Wildcat vault is fairly simple: borrowing and lending between two parties - but that simplicity belies creative applications.

Consider the following examples - all are well served by making use of Wildcat:

* Acquiring temporary inventory to provide a market spread for an asset,
* Bringing long-dated call options on new assets on-chain,
* Raising funds without issuing a token immediately (foregoing an initial LBP), or
* Issuing interest-bearing variants of assets held in escrow, creating an on-chain bond

If you have admin costs associated with middle and back-office functionality because you're handling loans OTC via Telegram or the like, you're probably going to find using a Wildcat vault useful, since you can track everything using a Wildcat vault.
