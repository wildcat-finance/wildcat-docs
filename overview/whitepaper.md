# Whitepaper

The bulk of the ideology, design decisions and high-level logic behind the protocol can be read in the Wildcat whitepaper. It's not technical, and intended to be a _fairly_ easy read barring some presented examples about how withdrawals work.

Most of the content is expanded on in this Gitbook, however, so if you've read this site top to bottom you're not going to be missing out by skipping it: there have been some changes in implementation since the release of v0.2 of the whitepaper, so in that sense if there is a conflict, this Gitbook supercedes.



**v0.2 \[Release Date: 4 September 2023]:**\
