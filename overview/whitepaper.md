# Whitepaper

The bulk of the ideology, design decisions and high-level logic behind the protocol can be read in the Wildcat whitepaper. It's not highly technical, and intended to be a _fairly_ easy read barring some presented examples which you can skip over.

Most of the content is expanded on in this Gitbook, however, so if you've read this site top to bottom you're not going to be missing out by skipping it.\
