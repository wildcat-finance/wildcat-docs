# Whitepaper

The bulk of the ideology, design decisions and high-level logic behind the protocol can be read in the Wildcat whitepaper. It's not technical, and intended to be a _fairly_ easy read barring some presented examples about how withdrawals work.

Most of the content is expanded on in this Gitbook, however, so if you've read this site top to bottom you're not going to be missing out by skipping it.\
