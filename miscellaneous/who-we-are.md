# Who Built This

This is always the least interesting part of any protocol or website, truth be told.

The Wildcat protocol was conceived of and built by **Wildcat Labs**, which deployed and currently operates the archcontroller of the protocol referenced in [Contract Deployments](../technical-overview/contract-deployments.md).

As a potted history, Wildcat V1 was built between June 2022 - October 2023 and deployed in November 2023. Wildcat V2 was built in gradual iterations between February - August 2024.

Just saying 'Wildcat Labs' doesn't do justice to the number of people involved though, so if you want some actual names:
