## Hi.

Welcome to the Wildcat documentation. We recognise that a protocol's Gitbook is - as a rule - only ever read by three categories of people:

* Security auditors working out if something is broken,
* Protocol researchers working out if something is worth posting about, and
* Lawyers working out if something is actually legal.

With that in mind, we'll keep this high-level page brief.\
\
If you're an **auditor or developer**, you want:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you're a **protocol researcher** looking for content for their next thread, you want:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

And if you're a **lawyer or a regulator**, you want:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Beyond that, the documentation is yours to enjoy (or not) at your leisure. We didn't enjoy writing it, but if you happen to enjoy reading it, then that all comes out fine in the wash.\


Hic sunt dragones.
