## Hi there.

Welcome to the Wildcat protocol documentation.

We recognise that a protocol Gitbook is - as a rule - read by three distinct categories of people:

* _Potential users and researchers_ working out if something is actually useful,
* _Security auditors_ working out if something is actually broken, and
* _Lawyers and regulators_ working out if something is actually legal.

With that in mind, we'll keep this high-level page brief.

## Users/Researchers



You might as well start at the beginning.

{% content-ref url="overview/introduction.md" %}
[introduction.md](overview/introduction.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



***

## Auditors/Developers



Contract deployments, gas profiles etc can be found under the following section:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

More specifically, if you're taking part in an audit or validating a potential bug, please refer to:

{% content-ref url="technical-overview/security-developer-dives/" %}
[security-developer-dives](technical-overview/security-developer-dives/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

\
If you're interested in reading about our on-chain protection or previous security reviews:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Lawyers/Regulators:

{% endcontent-ref %}



Beyond that, the documentation is yours to enjoy (or not) at your leisure. \


Hic sunt dragones.
