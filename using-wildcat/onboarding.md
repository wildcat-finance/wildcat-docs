description: How to make use of the Wildcat protocol.

# Onboarding

The Wildcat protocol is fundamentally permissioned in both roles that it is possible to fill while using it. The primary difference is that it is the Wildcat protocol itself that  grants permission to borrower candidates to deploy markets, whereas borrowers are the ones that themselves grant permission to their selected lenders to interact with the markets that they deploy.

## Borrowers



## Lenders

If you're a party that wishes to fulfil the role of a lender, Wildcat itself cannot help onboard you - this must be done by an extant borrower that has deployed a market.

On the protocol UI, we intend to provide contact points for such borrowers (i.e. email, Telegram), however the protocol does not play any further role in this process.

In terms of any KYC/AML policy that must be followed in order for a lender to be onboarded, Wildcat defers this entirely to the borrowers.&#x20;

Note that addresses which are flagged as sanctioned by the Chainalysis oracle contract are prevented from interacting in any way with the protocol - although it's a _brave_ entity that tries asking for credit from one of these.
