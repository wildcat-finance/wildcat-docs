# On Sanctions

We do not expect this to happen to any users of the protocol, but we have accounted for the potential that a lender address is added to a national sanctions list such as the OFAC SDN in a repeat of the Tornado Cash incident of August 2022.

The strict liability nature of transfers to and from addresses that have been tagged in such a manner means that we need to account for the potential for them to poison a entire market. It is depressing that we had to factor this in, but this is the reality that we live in and we need to account for it.

Here's how we've done it:

### Lender Gets Sanctioned



### Borrower Gets Sanctioned

We've spent this entire section discussing what happens if a lender is tagged, with no attention paid to what happens if the _borrower_ is. If this happens, per the Service Agreement of the protocol, the entire vault is immediately considered irrepably&#x20;
